<p>Hi Friend,</p><p>Thank you for joining our course. We hope you will get the most out of this course.</p><p>We have good news for you. As you've realized, we have started renewing this course with a better explanation and much better content. Until now, you saw the new lectures. However, after this lecture, you will see the old videos of this course. But we continue adding new lectures very often and this course will be the most complete and comprehensive SQL course on the platform very soon. (30-35+ hours approximately).</p><p>If you want to contribute this hard work, you can support &amp; motivate us for better work by leaving a review for our course.</p><p>By the way, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask.</p><p>We'll be here to help you.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Oracle Masters Team.</p>
