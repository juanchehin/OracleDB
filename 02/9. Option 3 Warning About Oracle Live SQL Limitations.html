<p>Dear Students;</p><p>You have to know that there are <strong>some limitations </strong>in Oracle Live SQL, so you cannot do everything in the course using Live SQL, but, you can do more than 90% of the course using Live SQL.</p><p>For example:</p><p>Â· Substitution variable is not allowed</p><p>When you try to do this, it will give you an error:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">select * from hr.employees
where employee_id= &amp;no;</pre><p>Or </p><ul><li><p>Creating users is not allowed</p></li><li><p>Create tablespace is not allowed. </p></li><li><p><strong>Or you cannot use some commands such as DESCRIBE&nbsp;(DESC) or INFORMATION (INFO) commands that you can use with the SQL Plus or SQL Developer tools. Because these are not SQL commands. They are just commands that are specifically created for these softwares (Oracle SQL Developer, SQL Plus) </strong></p></li></ul><p>For further information, you can click on help in Oracle Live SQL&nbsp;to know more.</p><p>Best Regards,</p><p>Oracle Master.</p>
